# Reverse Jim Cramer Index

 The idea was to scrape all of Jim Cramer's bullish picks for the year (2022) and short 1 stock each recommendation. That said, the results are about what I expected them to be: Jim only being correct a small percent of the times. For every five stocks that he recommends his viewers buy, only 1 proved to have a bullish trend in the market.
